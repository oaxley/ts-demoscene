## **Algorithm**

Nothing fancy here. You just draw a thick bar (50 pixels) with a color gradient from black to red 
then red to black. The bar has to be as wide as the screen, because in the old times, they were 
drawn on the screen by the CRT beam under the VGA controller.

Then for the animation, a simple sine wave do the trick.
